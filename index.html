<p><em>Wult</em> stands for &quot;Wake Up Latency Tracer&quot;, and this is a project providing tools for measuring
C-state latency in Linux. The project provides 2 tools:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>wult</em> - measures CPU C-state exit latency in Linux. This is the main deliverable of the project.</li>
<li><em>ndl</em> - measures the memory access latency observed by a PCIe network card when the CPU is is
in a C-state. However, this is a much more of a &quot;niche&quot; tool documented in a
<a class="reference external" href="pages/ndl.html">separate section</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important note</strong>: both <em>wult</em> and ndl are research, debugging and tracing tools which require
superuser privileges and must not be used in production environment.</p>
<p>The documentation for this project is scarce and imperfect, but we are improving it over time.

<div class="section" id="wult-presentation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">1 Wult presentation</a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/Opk92aQyvt0?t=8270">Here is a video recording of wult presentation</a>
by Artem Bityutskiy at Linux Plumbers Conference in 2019. The presentation begins at &quot;2:17:50&quot; and
it gives a high level <em>wult</em> introduction.</p>
<p>The presentation focuses on wult kernel drivers and some of the details may be out of date.
But here important highlights.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We did not submit wult drivers upstream yet.</li>
<li>In addition to the I210 NIC measurement method, <em>wult</em> also supports the &quot;timer&quot; measurement method,
so it will work on any modern x86 system even without an Intel I210 NIC.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="principle-of-operation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">1 Principle of operation</a></h2>
<p>Here is how <em>wult</em> works at a very high level.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Schedule a delayed interrupt to happen at future time <em>LaunchTime</em>.</li>
<li>Let the CPU enter a C-state, where CPU stops executing instructions and saves power.</li>
<li>At <em>LaunchTime</em>, the delayed interrupt fires and the CPU starts exiting the C-state. This
process will take some time.</li>
<li>When the CPU starts executing instructions, we take the time after idle timestamp (<em>TAI</em>).</li>
<li>The C-state exit latency is <em>TAI</em> - <em>LaunchTime</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is repeated tens or hundreds of thousands of times and the data are collected in a CSV
file. <em>Wult</em> provides a capability for analyzing the CSV file (finding the median, percentiles, etc)
as well as a capability for visualizing the test results (scatter plots, histograms).</p>
<div class="section" id="measured-cpu">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">1.2. Measured CPU</a></h3>
<p>By default, <em>wult</em> measures C-state latency of CPU 0 (the first CPU you'll see in '/proc/cpuinfo').
The delayed interrupts are affinitized to the measured CPU. However, you can measure any other
CPU as well - there is a command line option for this. But only one CPU is measured at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="measurement-methods">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">1.3 Measurement methods</a></h3>
<p>Today <em>wult</em> supports two delayed interrupt sources: <em>nic</em> and <em>timer</em>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Timer - the interrupt comes from the Local APIC timer block of the measured CPU.</li>
<li>Nic - the interrupt comes from a PCIe NIC (network card).</li>
</ol>
<p>The C-state latency measurements vary depending on the source of the delayed interrupt. We refer to
these also as &quot;<em>nic</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>timer</em>&quot; (or &quot;<em>tdt</em>&quot;) measurement methods. More on &quot;timer&quot; vs &quot;nic&quot; is
in <a class="reference external" href="#irq-source">this section</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usage-models">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">2 Usage models</a></h2>
<p id="id1">There are 2 <em>wult</em> usage models - <strong>local</strong> and <strong>remote</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="local-usage">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">2.1 Local usage</a></h3>
<img alt="Examples of local wult usage." id="local-usage-model" src="images/wult-local-usage-model.jpg" />
<p>In case of local usage model, the user runs <em>wult</em> on the SUT. <em>Wult</em> measures the SUT and stores
the measurement results on the SUT.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remote-usage">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">2.2 Remote usage</a></h3>
<img alt="Example of remote wult usage." id="remote-usage-model" src="images/wult-remote-usage-model.jpg" />
<p>In case of local usage model, the user runs <em>wult</em> on the controller. <em>Wult</em> connects to the SUT
over the network, exercises the SUT, and stores the results on the controller.</p>
<p>In the remote usage model a single controller may exercise many SUTs at the same time (multiple
instances of <em>wult</em> running simultaneously). The can be stored at the same place on the controller.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-hardware-setup">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">3 The hardware setup</a></h2>
<p>Since the CPU is already equipped with timers, the &quot;<em>timer</em>&quot; measurement method does not require
anything special. Just run wult in local or remote modes. In case of the &quot;<em>nic</em>&quot; method, the SUT
(System Under Test) should have an Intel I210 NIC.</p>
<p>Intel I210 is a 1GbE network chip, several vendors ship (or shipped) network cards based on I210.
For example, we use the HP I210-T1 Network Adapter (E0X95AA).</p>
<p>Plug the network card to an appropriate PCIe slot (check <a class="reference external" href="#irq-source">this section</a>). You do not
need to connect this NIC to the network (no cable needed).</p>
<p>The important thing, however, is that you should not use this NIC for anything else, it has to be
dedicated to <em>wult</em>. It is OK to have multiple I210 adapters on you system, as long as one of them
is dedicated to <em>wult</em>. Here are two example SUT configurations.</p>
<img alt="Example wult HW setup for the &quot;nic&quot; measurement method." src="images/wult-hw-setup.jp" />
<p>In the left picture the SUT has only one NIC dedicated to <em>wult</em>. The SUT is not connected to any
network and the user is logged in via a physically attached keyboard and monitor.</p>
<p>In the right picture the SUT is connected to a LAN with another NIC, but it has a separate NIC is
dedicated to <em>wult</em>. The user is logged in via SSH.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interrupt-source">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">4 Interrupt source</a></h2>
<p id="irq-source">Measuring C-state wake latency is based on delayed interrupts, and today <em>wult</em> supports
two delayed interrupt sources: <em>nic</em> and <em>timer</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="timer">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">4.1 Timer</a></h3>
<p>In case of the &quot;timer&quot; interrupt source <em>wult</em> uses the CPU timers for scheduling delayed interrupts.
On most modern Intel chips every core has a LAPIC block which provides the capability of arming
timers for this core. Wult uses the &quot;TSC deadline timers&quot; LAPIC capability to arm delayed interrupts
that fire at a very precise moment in the future. This is why <em>wult</em>'s &quot;timer&quot; measurement method
is also referred to as &quot;<em>tdt</em>&quot; (TSC Deadline Timer).</p>
<img alt="Timer interrupt illustration." src="images/wult-irq-source-timer.jpg" />
<p>The picture illustrates a timer interrupt on an Intel Xeon chip. The chip contains many cores,
but only one core is being measured (in case of hyper-threading, on hyper-thread within the core is
measured). This core has a LAPIC block, and the interrupt is generated by LAPIC.</p>
<p>Just for reference: MC is a Memory Controller, LLC is the last level cache (shared between the
cores). P-unit is a microcontroller that is responsible for power and performance features like
C-states, P-states, etc. This is just an example, and different Intel chips have a different
design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nic">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">4.2 Nic</a></h3>
<p>In case of the &quot;nic&quot; interrupt source the interrupts are generated by a PCIe network card (NIC).</p>
<img alt="NIC interrupt illustration." src="images/wult-irq-source-nic.jpg" />
<p>Notice that the interrupt source is much further from the measured core in this case. The interrupt
signal has to travel via PCIe link(s) and bridge(s) into the IIO block, and then it gets routed to
the measured CPU.</p>
<p>Today, only the Intel I210 NIC is supported, but more NIC types may be supported in the future.
This NIC has a built-in crystal oscillator and provides an independent clock, which can be read by
the CPU. The CPU can program the NIC to generate an interrupt when NIC's clock counter reaches
certain value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="timer-vs-nic">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">4.3 Timer vs Nic</a></h3>
<p>Both NIC and timer methods measure CPU C-state latency, and they may produce similar or different
result depending various factors. Let's look at some of them.</p>
<div class="section" id="c-state-pre-wake">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">4.3.1 C-state pre-wake</a></h4>
<p>Some Intel CPUs have able to pre-wake the CPU from a C-state if there is a timer firing soon.
The P-unit on such systems is timer-aware and optimizes some of the C-states. Not every Intel chip,
however, has this feature.</p>
<p>Interrupts from a NIC are cannot be predicted by the P-unit and therefore, the C-state pre-wake
feature cannot reduce the measured C-state latency.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="results/ivt-c6-hfm-nic-vs-tdt/index.html">Here is an example test result</a> for an Intel Xeon
E5-2697 v2 system. It is actually a diff comparing C-state latency for the &quot;nic&quot; and &quot;timer&quot;
measurement methods. The deepest C-state was C6. Notice that the median wake latency is 73.8us (nic)
and 17.6us (timer). The timer method shows about 76% latency reduction.</p>
<p>In the example, the report ID for the &quot;timer&quot; method is &quot;ivt-tdt-c6-hfm-noaspm&quot;. Just for
convenience, here is a small decoder:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ivt - comes from IvyTown, name of the server platform that we tested.</li>
<li>tdt - comes from &quot;TSC Deadline Timer&quot;, another name for the &quot;timer&quot; method that we use.</li>
<li>c6 - the deepest C-state Linux was allowed to request when we ran <em>wult</em>.</li>
<li>hfm - comes from &quot;High Frequency Mode&quot;, same as base frequency. This means that in this test
result we locked CPU frequency to HFM, so CPU frequency transitions were disabled.</li>
<li>noaspm - PCIe ASPM was disabled.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pcie-aspm">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">4.3.2 PCIe ASPM</a></h4>
<p>PCIe ASPM (Active State Power Management) is a PCIe power management feature, described in PCIe
specifications and supported by many Intel chips. This feature is about PCI links power management -
when a link is not used, it can be sent into a low power state such as L1. In this state the link
cannot be used, so when there are data to transfer, the link is transitioning to the L0 state. This
transition takes time and often requires link re-training.</p>
<p>PCIe ASPM is typically transparent to Linux - the hardware and firmware manages link states
automatically. However, Linux can enable and disable ASPM for PCIe devices.</p>
<p>Enabling PCIe ASPM for the I210 NIC will increase the measured C-state latency when using the &quot;nic&quot;
method, and won't affect the measured C-state latency when using the &quot;timer&quot; method.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="results/ivt-nic-c6-hfm-aspm-vs-noaspm/index.html">Here is a diff</a> for an Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2
system. It compares C-state latency for PCIe ASPM enabled and disabled configurations. The deepest
C-state was C6. The median wake latency is 82.6us (ASPM on) and 73.8us (ASPM off), which means that
PCIe ASPM adds about 8.8 microseconds to the median.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pci-topology">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">4.3.3 PCI topology</a></h4>
<p>In case of the &quot;nic&quot; measurement method, the location of the NIC in the PCIe matters. E.g., consider
a 2-socket server system with the following PCIe slots.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Slot A is connected directly to the IIO block (part of the &quot;north complex&quot;) of socket 0.</li>
<li>Slot B is connected directly to the IIO block of socket 1.</li>
<li>Slot C is connected to PCH, which is connected to socket 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we are measuring C-state latency of CPU0, which is on core 0 of socket 0. In this case Slot
A provides the shortest and fastest path. Slot B provides a bit longer and slower path, because
interrupts (typically MSI messages) will be delivered to socket 1, and then to socket 0. And slot C
provides provides a longer path as well.</p>
